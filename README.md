# TBMaker
In this project we tried to simplify the testbench
making process and to check every (and every) 
possible input at the fastest time possible. 

The TBMaker supports 3 types of inputs: 

1.std_logic 

2.std_logic_vector (any size) 

3.integers 

And also has  a GUI that gets the file and then 
creates the testbench at the given directory. 

There are 2 given examples (and_gate and alu). 
Make sure to leave space between every element 

in your VHDL code if you want to make this work.
